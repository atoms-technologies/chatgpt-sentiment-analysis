Sure, here's a simple README file outlining the assignment in two phases. I've used markdown to make it easy to read and understand:

# NodeJS Application for Sentimental Analysis with ChatGPT APIs

This NodeJS application allows users to upload Word documents and perform sentimental analysis using ChatGPT APIs. The assignment will be divided into two phases:

## Phase 1: Document Upload and Sentimental Analysis

In this phase, we will create a basic NodeJS application that allows users to upload Word documents and performs sentimental analysis on the uploaded content using ChatGPT APIs. The application will be straightforward without user authentication or persistent storage.

### Steps to Complete Phase 1:

1. Setup Environment: Ensure you have NodeJS and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

2. Clone Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

4. Get ChatGPT API Access: Sign up for an API key from ChatGPT API provider (e.g., OpenAI).

5. Set API Key: Add your ChatGPT API key to the application (preferably through environment variables) to authenticate the API requests.

6. Start the Server: Run `npm start` to start the NodeJS server.

7. Upload Word Document: Use the application's API on [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to allow users to upload Word documents.

8. Perform Sentimental Analysis: Implement the logic to send the uploaded document content to the ChatGPT API for sentimental analysis.

9. Return Results: Show the analysis results to the user as an API response.

## Phase 2: Authentication, Storage, and Database Integration

In this phase, we will enhance the NodeJS application to include user authentication, database integration to store analysis results, and provide users with access to their records.

### Steps to Complete Phase 2:

1. User Authentication: Implement a user authentication system (e.g., using JWT tokens) to allow users to sign up and log in.

2. Uploaded documents need not be stored to any cloud storage.

3. Store Analysis Results: Create a database schema (MongoDB) to store analysis results along with user information.

4. File Upload for Authenticated Users: Allow only authenticated users to upload Word documents.

5. Sentimental Analysis and Database Update: Use the ChatGPT API to perform sentimental analysis on the uploaded documents and store the results in the database.

6. User Records Retrieval: Implement set of API endpoints that allows authenticated users to retrieve all their analysis records, retrieve a specific analysis record by its ID.

## Phase 3: User Management

In this phase, we will enhance the NodeJS application to include user management operations.

### Steps to Complete Phase 3:

1. User should be able to change their password.

2. User should be able to reset their password if they forget it, by receiving an email with an updated password.

3. User should be able to upload a profile picture and that picture should be stored in AWS S3 buckets. The application should only Store the part of the image.

## Conclusion

By completing both phases, you will have built a fully functional NodeJS application that allows users to upload Word documents, perform sentimental analysis using ChatGPT APIs, and store the results securely in AWS S3 and a database. Users can authenticate, view their analysis records, and retrieve specific records if needed.
